# classCommandSystem

JsMacros command system.

## Setup

Download this repo or clone it with `git clone https://github.com/Johannes7k75/classCommandSystem`  
**Place it in the `Macros` folder**, put the `index.js` on the `JoinServer` event.

I recommend it on `JoinServer` because it closes the Script Context on `Disconnect` to avoid any erros.

## Config File?

Yes you can use a config to store some Strings.  
You can place the prefix and chatPrefix in it so you dont have to change it in the code.  
In addition you can store other things in there like apiKeys or other things.  

### Where to place the config?

Just put it in the classCommandSystem folder.
I have already placed on to demonstate it.
